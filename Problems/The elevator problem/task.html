<h2>The elevator problem</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Assume you are taking a glass elevator to the 10th floor of a business center. While below the 6th floor, all you see is twigs of the trees growing near the center. Once you get higher though, you get a wonderful view of the city.</p> 
  <p>Set the variable <code class="java">n = 1</code> which will increase the number of the floor you've reached consequently, one by one. Check if that number is not greater than <code class="java">10</code> in the <code class="java">while</code> loop. If you are lower than the 6th floor, display <code class="java">Tree!</code>, otherwise, display <code class="java">City!</code></p>
