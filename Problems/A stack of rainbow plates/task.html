  <p>Imagine that you have a collection of plates in all colors of the rainbow. First, you put them on each other in the following order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. All of a sudden, seven of your friends decide to come visit you, so you have to set the table using all of the plates.</p> 
  <p>Create an empty array and implement a stack of plates: first, save the names of all colors of plates to the array one by one, then delete them one by one. Display the names of the colors while deleting them (tip: use <code class="java">console.log(array.pop())</code> instead of <code class="java">array.pop()</code> to display the deleted element).</p>
